# Universal Yeoman Generator

This Yeoman generator will give the possibility to generate front/back project, whatever the technology. 

These are the first archetypes you can use : 
* Front
    * Very simple HTML/JS/CSS calling a REST API (3000 port)
* Back
    * NodeJS server running on the port 3000

## How can I use it ?

For example, if you want to create a front and a back, you need, for the moment, run the generator twice.
